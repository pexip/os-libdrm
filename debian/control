Description: Userspace interface to kernel DRM services -- development files
 This library implements the userspace interface to the kernel DRM
 services.  DRM stands for "Direct Rendering Manager", which is the
 kernelspace portion of the "Direct Rendering Infrastructure" (DRI).
 The DRI is currently used on Linux to provide hardware-accelerated
 OpenGL drivers.
 .
 This package provides the development environment for libdrm.
